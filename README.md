# Neutrino-DeepLearning

My research work for Hyperkamiokande experiment on e-/gamma classification using deep learning.

Neutrinos are some particles that are emmited by high energy events like supernovas or solar flares.

The purpose is to design a neural network that can efficiently classify the neutrino interactions recolected by the Cherenkov radiation in some observatories around the world.

There are many files regarding raw data transformation, visualization and some tests for classification using convolutional neural networks using Keras/Tensorflow.
